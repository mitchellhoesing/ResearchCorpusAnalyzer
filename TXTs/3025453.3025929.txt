bABSTRACTn We consider a large dataset of realworld onroad driving from a 100car naturalistic study to explore the predictive power of driver glances and specifically to answer the following question what can be predicted about the state of the driver and the state of the driving environment from a 6second sequence of macroglances The contextbased nature of such glances allows for application of supervised learning to the problem of visionbased gaze estimation making it robust accurate and reliable in messy realworld conditions
