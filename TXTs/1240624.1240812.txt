bABSTRACTnnWe demonstrate the use of uncertain prediction in a system for pedestrian navigation via audio with a combination ofnGlobal Positioning System data a music player inertial sensing magnetic bearing data and Monte Carlo sampling for a density following task where a listeners music is modulated according to the changing predictions of user position with respect to a target density in this case a trajectory or path
