ABSTRACT
Using scientific discoveries to inform design practice is an
important, but difficult, objective in HCI. In this paper, we
provide an overview of Translational Science in HCI by trian-
gulating literature related to the research-practice gap with
interview data from many parties engaged (or not) in trans-
lating HCI knowledge. We propose a model for Translational
Science in HCI based on the concept of a continuum to de-
scribe how knowledge progresses (or stalls) through multiple
steps and translations until it can influence design practice.
The model offers a conceptual framework that can be used
by researchers and practitioners to visualize and describe
the progression of HCI knowledge through a sequence of
translations. Additionally, the model may facilitate a precise
identification of translational barriers, which allows devis-
ing more effective strategies to increase the use of scientific
findings in design practice.

1 INTRODUCTION
Translational Science (TS) is the study of scientific knowl-
edge progression from academia to practice and back. Taking
findings from a basic science discovery to real-world impact
is a complex process that requires both research (e.g., lab-
oratory and applied research) and non-research activities
(e.g., design and engineering) [28]. In this paper, we work
under the premise that there is a general goal in applied
fields to translate scientific knowledge to inform the work
of professionals. In HCIs case, it means influencing design
practice as an endpoint [31, 69].

However, HCI papers offer limited support for practice. For
example, only 7% of CHI 2011 papers were oriented towards
supporting design practice [56]. At the same time, there
is a growing expectation from industry practitioners, gov-
ernments, and the general public that scientific knowledge
should be useful to society [57, 64]. Practitioners, specifically,
have voiced concerns with the applicability of HCI research
findings [11, 19, 36, 37]. Consequently, mapping the Trans-
lational Science process is necessary to understand how to
increase the use of HCI discoveries in design practice.

Past research in HCI has approached TS using the research-
practice gap metaphor. This metaphor implies a separation
between two sides or communities: academic researchers
and design practitioners. However, the research-practice
gap metaphor can oversimplify the translation work that
HCI scholars and design practitioners do. For example, HCI
scholars often draw on other disciplines to inspire applied
research, such as cognitive sciences, psychology, and anthro-
pology theories (e.g., Hutchinss Distributed Cognition [34]
from cognitive science, Leontievs Activity Theory [44] from
psychology, Suchmans Situated Action [67] from anthro-
pology). The research-practice gap narrative overlooks this

type of translational work, and if there are multiple gaps,
they are likely more nuanced. Focusing on a single set of
barriers from one gap may limit how translational problems
are approached [7].
If the research-practice gap metaphor is limited, what

model might better depict Translational Science in HCI? In
this paper, we present a literature review and interview study
of HCI community members representing various parties to
the Translational Science process. Through our findings, we
contribute descriptions of the translational research practices
involving HCI researchers, other scholars, design practition-
ers, and translators such as industry researchers and science
communicators. Ourmain contribution is a continuummodel
for Translational Science in HCI, providing a foundation for
future work to discuss Translational Science in HCI.

2 METHODS
Following Zimmerman et al.s process to create the model of
interaction design research within HCI [75], we conducted a
literature review, interviewed stakeholders in the HCI com-
munity, and constructed a model for Translational Science
in HCI. Our literature review consisted of publications on
TS, translational research, and research-practice gaps in HCI
and other applied fields, such as public health, management
science, communication, and education. Second, we inter-
viewed academic researchers, design practitioners and stu-
dents, entrepreneurs, and science communicators. Literature
review findings were compared to participant perspectives.

For interviews, we first recruited six HCI scholars experi-
enced in research, design, community and media outreach,
entrepreneurship, teaching, and policymaking to obtain a

panorama of translation in HCI and to iterate on our research
protocol and preliminary model. In the second interview
stage, we broadened recruiting criteria and interviewed 37
participants engaged in HCI-related research and practice
fields. We highlight that our participants came from many
different traditions such as computer science, design, indus-
trial engineering, anthropology, English literature, social
psychology, interaction, and user experience design, design
education, user experience research, and product manage-
ment; and worked in academia, industry, and government.
We also interviewed science communicators and communi-
cation managers. We had participants with many years of
experience in HCI-related fields, as well as participants who
are newer members of this community, and even some that at
first did not consider themselves members (such as communi-
cation managers and some design practitioners). See detailed
participant information on Table 1, and in Supplementary
materials.
We asked participants to define their perceptions of the

gap between research and practice, where translational work
takes place in HCI, and what they have done regarding trans-
lation. As in the first stage, participants commented on the
current version of our model for TS in HCI.

The development of the model, the literature review, and
interviews were interdependent. The model provided key-
words for literature searches and framing concepts for the
creation of the interview protocol. At the same time, we did
not limit our literature review to a predetermined set of key-
words; some concepts only emerged from our readings and
interviews. We iterated on the model after each interview.
After many months, a detailed model emerged from formal
data analysis and in-depth critique sessions.

3 TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE IN HCI AND LINKED
FIELDS

We start by defining terms related to Translational Science
(TS) such as research, practice, theory, and the research-
practice gap. First, TS studies the transformation of knowl-
edge through successive fields of research from a basic sci-
ence discovery to real-world impact, a complex process that
requires both theory-producing steps (basic and applied) and
non-research steps (dissemination, implementation, design).
The study of each step is called translational research [28].

Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) is "a discipline con-
cerned with the design, evaluation, and implementation of
interactive computing systems for human use and with the
study of the major phenomenon surrounding them" [69]. We
acknowledge that HCI is a broad discipline that encompasses
many fields and that has evolved throughout the years [9]. In
the field of HCI, TS is about translating rich understandings
of people and their interactions with technology with a goal
of influencing the design of interactive systems.

Paper 1 Page 2



On one side of the HCI work are theoretical findings. In
this paper, we use Yvonne Rogerss and Ben Schneidermans
definitions of theory: knowledge enabling understandings
and generalizations about specific phenomena. Schneider-
man even provides a list of instantiations of knowledge: the-
ories (rules, frameworks, models), descriptions (terminology,
taxonomies, ontologies), causal explanations and predictions;
and more practical knowledge such as solutions (problem
fixes, improved processes) and guidelines (recommendations,
patterns, tutorials) [59, 64]. On the other end of the trans-
lational work is design practice, the process or practice of
devising, planning, or constructing something, focusing on
the design of effective, user-friendly, interactive computing
systems [26, 31, 70]. The goal of the TS problem in HCI is
thus to facilitate the adoption, implementation, and insti-
tutionalization of theoretical findings into design practice
(much like what is described in [57]).

Despite acknowledgments of the value of theoretical in-
sights about people in design practice, studies have repeat-
edly shown that these insights are rarely adopted [11, 19, 54].
Prior work on HCI translations has primarily described the
process using a gap metaphor [7]. The research-practice
gap metaphor is a common concept that has been used in
HCI to describe an undesired space that allegedly exists be-
tween the research and the practice of the discipline [7, 31].
Much work describes multiple translational barriers that
explain why a single gap exists, and the "gap" problema-
tization inspired many studies proposing ways to bridge
it [19, 22, 31, 37, 50, 64].
Building on the gap metaphor, Gray et al. [32] have sug-

gested a trickle-down and bubble-up model, emphasizing
that the interaction between the research and practice com-
munities is bidirectional. Bubble-up describes the efforts of
the HCI community to abstract situated knowledge and prac-
tice of methods, tools, or concepts into refined theory. The
trickle-down describes the way adaptation of research and
theory takes place in design practice, including the use of
methods, tools, or concepts that originate in academia.

However, despite the importance of acknowledging a gap
between research and practice [50], a gap metaphor might
be simplistic and might limit how we think about TS in
HCI. Beck posited that the gap metaphor influences how
HCI researchers set translational problems to focus on barri-
ers, which has implications for the kinds of solutions they
seek [7]. Frequently, HCI researchers attempt to bridge the
gap by pushing HCI knowledge into practitioner use by pre-
senting research papers in different formats [19, 32, 46, 54],
in an attempt to make the theoretical insights "more perti-
nent and easier to use for developers" [12]. The proposed
solutions tackle barriers that HCI researchers and practi-
tioners have identified as reasons for the research-practice
gap to exist. For example, recent work has described issues

with the terminology and applicability of research papers,
how practitioners may lack access to academic resources,
the different cultures and skill sets of researchers and design-
ers [19, 50, 53, 56] and many more [36].
Countering the focus on barriers, Beck and Ekbia [7] en-

couraged the HCI community to focus on the connections
and continuities between theory and practice in HCI. In this
context, Beck and Ekbia suggest that a new metaphor  the
continuum metaphor  which draws attention to the mutual
agreement, harmony, synergy, and support between research
and practice. However, how one can think of the HCI TS
problem as a continuum is unclear.

Expanding beyond HCI, our literature review shows that
"the gap" problem is also the dominant narrative in many
other fields, such as Psychology, Nursing, Human Resources,
Library Sciences, Management, Education, Social Work, and
more [10, 15, 23, 47, 52, 60, 61, 63]. Similarly, the gapmetaphor
is used to describe a disconnect between the research com-
munity and the practice community. Common barriers in-
clude practitioners being unaware of the latest findings [61],
thinking that research is not applicable to real-world prob-
lems [47, 63] or, if applicable, too difficult to implement [10],
and the insularity of academic work dissemination [15, 23].
In these fields, the work of Everett Rogers on diffusion

of innovations [57] has been very influential. For Rogers,
diffusion is the process by which a central source communi-
cates an innovation towards practitioners, among whom the
innovation is adopted over time or rejected. Rogerss work is
particularly influential in its descriptions of the work of trans-
lators to disseminate knowledge, and measures of knowledge
adoption. A major criticism of this work is that it represents
a one-way model, which is insufficient as knowledge flows
through multiple channels in parallel. Also, the centrality
of research producers in the model disregards the needs of
practitioners and what they have to offer researchers [55].
The biomedical and health sciences have begun using a

continuum metaphor to describe the progression of research
from basic science discovery to proposed human applica-
tion, to clinical treatment [28]. They have noted similar
issues with using a single gap to describe the discontinu-
ities between research and practice. Using a single gap had
become a source of confusion, as different research steps
had differing goals, settings, study designs, investigators,
and outcomes [74]. This confusion has hindered the proper
identification of translational barriers and prevented proper
resource allocation by funding agencies [74].
In their review article of the translational continuum in

Biomedicine, Drolet and Lorenzi discuss three "translational
chasms" (Ts or gaps) as the main landmarks in knowledge
progression in the continuum:

CHI 2019 Paper  CHI 2019, May 49, 2019, Glasgow, Scotland, UK

Paper 1 Page 3



T1 is the use of knowledge about disease mechanisms
in the development of diagnosis methods, therapy, and pre-
vention. T1 research is performed by scientists trained in
molecular biology, genetics, and other basic sciences work-
ing in laboratories. In contrast, ambulatory care settings are
the "laboratory" for T2 research, where applied interventions
further the understanding of T1 results by confronting them
with broader populations. T2 is known as the clinical trials
step, where safety and efficacy research occur. T3 requires
implementing scientific knowledge: applying and evaluating
interventions in real-world settings and of the disciplines
that inform the design of those interventions, such as clini-
cal epidemiology and evidence synthesis, but also commu-
nication theory, behavioral science, public policy, financing,
organizational theory, design, informatics, and mixed meth-
ods research. Finally, T3 is bridged when clinical practices
and guidelines are implemented to produce concrete public
health changes. For example, if an effective clinical applica-
tion is found (e.g., aspirin effectively decreases thrombosis in
individual patients), then it must be marketed and explained
to clinical practitioners, who may sometimes be trained in
the proper ways to administer a drug before public health
gains can be achieved. After T3 is bridged, public health im-
pact is studied via practice-based research, and feedback for
continual improvement follows (e.g., why are clinicians not
administering aspirin?).

The most noticeable differences between health and HCI
pertain to institutional and policy constraints that need to be
addressed to protect drugs and treatment users [48, 74]. Addi-
tionally, the continuum model shows the work of many par-
ties to progress knowledge through successive steps, rather
than focusing on the work of researchers and clinicians; such
as basic scientists, applied researchers, marketers, design-
ers, clinical practitioners, physicians, social workers, public
health researchers, policymakers [28, 68, 74].

There are drawbacks in using existing models to describe
TS in HCI, although we can learn from them. The health
model is field-specific, such as in how it deals with institu-
tional constraints. The diffusion model focuses on dissem-
inating information and does not address the importance
of offering applicable resources to practitioners, or learning
what is useful for them. On the other hand, health shows
many stakeholders working on a continuum of knowledge
progressions, supporting Beck and Ekhbias call [7]. The
diffusion of innovation shows how translators disseminate
information, resonating with Gray et al.s work [32].

Therefore, how could we rethink the research-practice gap
metaphor to represent HCIs unique process of knowledge
progression, incorporating learnings from other fields and
past work related to Translational Science?

4 MODEL OF TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE IN HCI
We propose a model for Translational Science in HCI (Fig-
ure 1). We ground the decisions that led to the design of the
proposed model in our interview findings. First, we present
how participants talked about the gap metaphor, transla-
tional science in the field, and the main actors in translational
science. Second, we describe how participants view and en-
act relationships that point to a progression of knowledge
between research and practice.
While most participants first described a single gap in

Translational Science, upon further reflection, many noted
issues with the dichotomy. Initially, participants defined TS
in HCI as a "BIG gap" or a "barrier" between researchers and
designers (P3, P11, P17, P22, P23, P26, P35, P39). Participants
would mention known research-practice barriers such as
accessing and understanding scientific work, as well as how
dissimilar incentive structures could be the biggest driver for
the gap between HCI researchers and Design practitioners.
Most participants, regardless of role, agreed that those

in the HCI field share the goal of improving products and
services for people, even if not directly. Therefore, we set the
end-goal of our proposed model as Design practice (Figure 1).
As participants described their personal experiences re-

lated to translational science and "the gap", the roles of addi-
tional parties in the progression of HCI knowledge surfaced
naturally, such as industry researchers and science commu-
nicators, as well as a nuanced and fluid variety of academic
researchers (e.g., P7 had worked in industry, launched a
startup in the past, and now focuses on design research and
teaching at her academic department).
At the end of the interview, after reflecting on their own

initial interpretations of a single research-practice gap, it
became clear to participants that the gap metaphor is insuf-
ficient to describe how multiple parties conduct a series of
translations. Most participants, especially HCI researchers,
noted their work falls in the Applied research step; they also

man [64], and the NSFNational Science Foundation [1]. Of note, similar to their academic counterparts, industry researchers
can engage in both Basic and Applied research. The model does not designate where academic or industry researchers reside
in the continuum.

Steps Description
Basic Research Basic research is performed without thought of practical ends, resulting in general knowledge to answer a large number of problems, though

it may not give a complete specific answer to any one of them. In HCI, basic research results in a foundational understanding of people,
technology, and design. It is achieved by researchers posing formative questions and investigating a topic through the scientific process
often in specific scenarios/contexts. Participants mentioned 3 main types of basic research relative to HCI: A) Research from other fields
such as anthropology and psychology that is drawn upon to conduct Applied research; B) Ethnographies conducted within the context of
how people use or are impacted by technologies, and C) HCI research probing the technological boundaries, demonstrating new potential
interaction capabilities and new experiences made possible by technological advances.

Applied Research Applied research provides complete answers to practical problems. In HCI, applied research results in practical, goal/solution-oriented
research. It is achieved by HCI researchers posing questions through the use of an embodiment of knowledge; study of interface efficacy
and how people relate to it; observation of tensions between people and technologies, safety, and ethics in realistic scenarios.

Design Practice HCI practitioners using HCI and design knowledge to create something new in the AIJmade world.AI Involves the deep consideration of
specific users, related stakeholders, technical and market requirements. Integration of art, science, and engineering to make aesthetically
functional interfaces.

noticed that the single gap narrative does not distinguish
Basic research.
In the HCI TS model, we used the T-terminology to de-

scribe different gaps between steps to facilitate more pre-
cise discussion about specific gaps (following Drolet and
Lorenzis model [28]). Drawing from our interviews, themost
prominent gaps in the HCI Translational Science model seem
to be between Basic and Applied research (TBA), between Ap-
plied research and Design practice (TAD), and between Basic
research and Design practice (TBD). We also heard about how
Bubble-up happens (supporting [32]), and finally, about gaps
within applied research in HCI. Table 2 shows descriptions
of the abovementioned steps and gaps with their unique
knowledge exchanges, translations, and barriers.
As can be seen on Figure 1 and Table 2, the model does

not designate where academic or industry researchers reside
in the continuum. Basic and Applied research can occur both
in academic or industry settings, and the same is true for
the design of interactive systems (e.g., university startup
incubators). Additionally, Applied research can be tightly
linked to basic research if conducted in an academic setting,
but in the industry, it gravitates towards design practice.

TAD  Applied Research to Design Practice
The gap between Applied research and Design practice is
what people most often refer to as the research-practice gap.
Participants said that basic research findings rarely influence
the work of design practitioners, which is one of the reasons
why translating basic into applied research is important.

Participants described known barriers to the use of re-
search findings by practitioners, such as understanding is-
sues due to the terminology in research contributions and
difficulty in accessing them. However, they highlighted that
applicability might be the most significant barrier keeping
applied research from influencing design practice.
P7 and P13, experienced in both academia and industry,

said that expecting HCI practitioners to read papers is unre-
alistic. A practitioner noted designers will not  and cannot
 spend the time to read papers: I dont have four hours to
read one paper, I just dont, I could get a lot done in those four
hours. Frankly, I do have 10 minutes to skim through a Medium
article. Ive never understood why in academia, they dont set
up an incentivization structure for academics to almost like
promote their research to industry (P35).

When researchers and designers meet and talk in person,
the terminology issue is lessened as they can speak directly
to each other and ask for clarification (P11, P13, P14, P30,
P39, P40). However, even at these rare occasions, designers

CHI 2019 Paper  CHI 2019, May 49, 2019, Glasgow, Scotland, UK

Paper 1 Page 5



do not get actionable information from researchers (P7, P11,
P29, P35). I have been to CHIplay, but there is a big barrier
between industry and academia. Very little of what I saw there
was applicable, and that event is the only direct contact I have
with academia. During the year, everyone is locked up in their
companies or universities and dont speak (P11, who runs a
virtual reality gaming company).

HCI researchers translating between applied research and
design practice described the applicability barrier as the most
important to address to successfully influence the work of de-
sign practitioners. P14, P30, and P32, all HCI professors, said
that designers do not care about using theories or detailed
terminology, only wanting to know what can be applied for
their particular case.

Many HCI researchers recognized that the long and diffi-
cult applied research process does not result in actionable
resources that can be offered to design practice, which, in
their view, is a big problem for HCI (P4, P7, P14, P19, P27,
P34). An industry researcher, who worked in a translational
medical science project after her doctorate, said that HCI
does not have enough research study findings that have been
shown to work in practice or practice-based research. Research
findings are not real world enough to be meaningful and appli-
cable (P16). This concern motivated P19, a long-time CHI
contributor, to engage with industry partners, tapping into
wider populations to generalize her study results, and to
learn how to translate her research findings into something
useful for practitioners.

We then asked participants what has worked in terms of
translations from applied research to design practice. Re-
searchers mentioned having success with a make it happen
approach. They described embedding in organizations as
consultants or doing design work along with practitioners,
first learning what those practitioners care about before of-
fering recommendations (P8, P19, P20, P21, P30, P32); and
creating actionable resources for practitioners to use, such as
easy to use research and design methods (P7, P14, P19, P32),
or open-source projects. P8 used an open-source model: it
was an open-source project, so they literally put the code up on
the wall and like went through it and used that as the jumping
off point to invent their startup and introduced the project
to practitioners in a hackathon.
P19 told the story of how the idea to create a design

method started: this industry guy asked for resources, and
then I asked myself: what do I give to this guy? Papers... and
academic research... are too hard for practitioners to get it.
Her approach was to study how to transform empirical data
from published studies into a design method. Connecting to
practice was a study in itself, a long one (P19).

Compatibility with existing workflows and demonstrated
utility affect adoption of assets and methods by practice, sup-
porting [57]. Scholars mentioned making assets compatible

with current industry practices (P8, P19), and the need for
these assets to prove their usefulness from the outset, such as
by connecting with metrics that practitioners value. I have
learned one lesson. Managers and bosses need to want it. They
need to be convinced and make that a part of their process.
They need to know what the practical outcome of the method
for them is. One manager told me: I will fail if I dont use this
method and thats when I knew I had succeeded (P19).

TBA  Basic to Applied Research
Participants, specifically researchers, pointed that apart from
TAD, there is also an important gap in the knowledge progres-
sion from basic to applied research, with its unique barriers.
First, translating basic knowledge into research products is
a challenging process that happens through collaborations
with parties who possess supportive skills. Second, there
seems to be a disconnect between HCI and other disciplines.

Participants noted that translating theory from the social
sciences, ethnography, or philosophy into tools for conduct-
ing applied research is complicated and often depends on
partnerships as they lack the skillset (P27, P28, P33, P43).
P24, a psychology professor, said my main goal is finding
reproducible regular patterns in peoples behavior that both
have real-life potential applicability or consequences, and at
the same time can be studied in a fairly controlled way. But I
want my studies to have an impact in real life.

Regarding this challenge, participant P27 posed a question
and a proposed path: How do we facilitate the interaction of
basic and applied researcher in HCI, long term, sustainable?
This is a big problem. We need to do more work on understand-
ing how this happens naturally, which might help us foster how
to facilitate this interaction. P28, also present in the group
interview, agreed, saying that he worked in projects with
collaborators from other fields in successful programs dedi-
cated to foster basic and applied research exchange, funded
by a Translational Medicine association.
A few participants described how basic and applied re-

search interact through joint projects. Basic researchers may
work with HCI researchers or practitioners to create designs
that can be used in detailed investigations. However, finding
these collaborations and establishing common-ground can
be challenging and costly (P7, P19, P24, P27, P28).

We hired a computer science Ph.D. student who
was a really good programmer. We met with him
and he prototyped a version that we had in mind.
My colleague and I may say oh lets do this,
not because we know that we have to do it, but
because we happened to think of it, but learning
from the programmer that would be difficult to
implement, we would think of something else.
(P27)

CHI 2019 Paper  CHI 2019, May 49, 2019, Glasgow, Scotland, UK

Paper 1 Page 6



However, P27 and P33 emphasized that collaborations
with students or designers are often temporary and expen-
sive, and that longer-term partnerships would be better. In
P27s case, the student soon graduated and left only the code.
Changing and deploying the code required someone to have
 or gain  familiarity with that particular technology stack.
P27 and his colleague spent a year with the project on a hold
because of this issue. P27 and P33, who are self-described ba-
sic researchers, even started learning design and engineering
skills to do applied work on their own.
Second, as the first point already suggests, participants

valued drawing on other domains of knowledge to create
work that is new and fresh (P30, P26). Researchers think
that engaging with diverse scholarship transforms them into
better scholars (P5, P17, P26, P28). Understanding is not a
barrier in TBA; while it can be difficult to quickly grasp other
research traditions, there is institutional support through
citations and a common understanding of papers as an output
to incentivize reading diverse work.
However, HCI scholars mentioned barriers to engaging

with other scholarship. Scholars do not feel incentivized to
participate in communities of interest that are peripheral to
HCI; P28, P29, and P35 said this stifles research innovation.
Most of the knowledge circulation in HCI happens within the
confines of the CHI community and other ACM conferences.

HCI researchers also said their work rarely feeds back into
the original bodies of theory from which they draw on. I
draw on social psychology theories and behavior change and
translate that into designs. So thats a translation. Usually,
youre drawing on many different theories to help inform one
coherent thing. Not the opposite. I dont feel like I contribute
to basic science (P7). Again, citation deficit was raised as
evidence for a basic-applied research gap (P3, P14). Partici-
pants did not mention efforts to facilitate engagement with
other disciplines, or to promote more and more relevant
citation exchanges.

TAA  Gap within Applied research
Participants described another disconnect within HCI in
academia, one specifically pertaining to how HCI research is
disseminated and reused in the field.While some participants
who frequently participate and publish at CHI boasted that
it is common to cross-pollinate work with their colleagues
diverse research (P1, P7, P19, P27, P32), others mentioned a
critical barrier related to citations, perhaps themain currency
in academia. Within sub-communities, research papers are
often not cited:

I speak directly to those issues. We use the same
keywords, publish in the same venues. It be-
comes a personal grudge, which is a problem
within HCI. You may not like my work, but

it should be cited. If you disagree with my ap-
proach or findings, cite it and explain why. (P2)

The reasons given by participants for the citation failure
were information overload and academic traditions. First,
participants mentioned that it is difficult to keep up with all
publications within an area of studies or across them (P1, P9,
P15, P17, P32, P43), which is curious as most of the knowl-
edge circulation happens within a few, well-known venues.
Regarding academic traditions, some researchers said that
authors can devalue ethnographies or systems development
if they do not engage with or understand it, which can
cause those researchers to not learn from or cite that work
(P4, P5, P19, P27). As in TBA, participants did not mention ef-
forts to promote more and more relevant citation exchanges
across HCI conferences tracks.

TBD  Basic Research to Design Practice
Our participants initially marked TBD as the rarest transla-
tional path. Basic researchers do not plan studies or write
papers with the objective of influencing practice; and P19
mentioned that HCI is so important because it sits in between
basic research and design practice to do the translation. For
P6, P17, P24, and P33, TBD is where the understanding and
access barriers are more salient. However, although rare,
participants acknowledged that basic research can influence
HCI practice, and provided a few examples.
One approach is to translate basic science into content

to be consumed more broadly. For example, pop psychol-
ogy books [6, 29] are often written by practitioners with
scientific training, sharing scientific findings blended with
personal industry experience or partnering with scholars.
None of our participants had written or helped to write such
kind of books; instead they accomplished other types of out-
reach such as participating in radio talks and contributing
to news articles about science (P6, P17, P24). Second, trans-
lating content and disseminating it for a targeted group of
practitioners, in events (P24, P43), and in discussions with
practitioners that are actively searching for new knowledge
to inform product development (P4, P8, P17, P30, P33). Third,
participants agreed that training in basic research affords
the abilities to partner with practitioners through research
method skills and deep scientific understanding (P6, P17, P24,
P28, P33, P40, P43).

Bubble-up
Bubble-up, an important aspect of our model (Figure 2), has
been discussed in prior work [32]. Our participants who
engaged in Bubble-up work described mostly researcher-led
strategies to help practice knowledge to influence research.
They also voiced the impression that most of their colleagues
do not do the same because they are either not personally

Paper 1 Page 7



interested in design, or for lack of incentive. For P15, It is
crucial for researchers to really engage with practitioners and
know how things are done in industry. This is, or should be, the
minimum requirement to contribute to design.
In our interviews, practitioners mentioned not engaging

with bubble-up. UX researchers and designers are most often
not incentivized to broadcast findings because of intellec-
tual property restrictions (P12, P35). However, disseminating
carefully vetted case studies in platforms such as Medium
has been more common among practitioners. Although our
participants did not have experience with such forms of com-
munication, they mentioned an interest in doing so for per-
sonal branding (P29, P39, P41, P42). Interestingly, we heard
from all HCI practitioners that instructors with professional
experience as designers or engineers effectively made the
academia-industry linkage (P35) in the classroom, bringing
knowledge from practice into the education of a new gener-
ation of practitioners. This view was consistent among HCI
professors who had industry experience (P10, P11, P13, P15,
P34, P35, P38).

HCI researchers interested in learning insights from prac-
tice put effort into a few strategies that they deem successful,
such as organizing and attending practitioner-oriented con-
ferences (P9, P13, P15, P24); keeping track of students who
go on to leading industry positions (P13, P29, P31); and using
online design groups: Im part of Facebook and Slack groups
to talk to practitioners. Most of the times we talk about new
tools or books, design trends, but sometimes deeper issues and
methods. Its very varied but focused on practice only. Its
almost like a crowdsourced design encyclopedia on current
topics. (P15). The Bubble-up goals that our participants men-
tioned were: to learn what practitioners care about (P9, P13,
P15, P24), to gain insights about design field trends (P13, P29,
P31), to improve teaching (P15) and syllabi (P13).

Different Translators and Translational Work
Through our interviews, we uncovered different types of
translations that address TS barriers: the design of example
products, people transfer, education, use of research knowl-
edge in industry research, and science communication.

Synthesizing Information into contextualized products. This
type of translation, achieved through the collaborative work
of basic researchers, applied researchers, and designers, can
entail both translating basic knowledge into research con-
cepts for testing and applied research into prototypes and
guidelines that can facilitate adoption in design practice.
In the interviews, we heard specific instances of transla-

tional work altering the original research insight to create a
new product to address more contextualized problems. Both
in TBA and in TAD, knowledge can get lost in translation
because of the synthetic nature of design, which is reflected

in the accounts of basic and applied researchers who have
engaged in translations (P8, P19, P24). P24 mentioned that a
foray into applied research required making many conces-
sions and changing their initial ideas because of technical
and design constraints. P19 in turn mentioned the need to
make a design method compatible with industry practices,
which required drastic adaptations.

The challenge in translating research into products or
methods is described by Chilana et al. through the creation
of a new venture born out of HCI research focusing on adop-
tion [17] and by the concept of appropriation used by Gray
et al. [32]. As seen in the previous paragraph, not only do
design practitioners partially appropriate knowledge, so do
researchers when attempting to bridge gaps.

People transfer as knowledge transfer. Chilana et al.s migra-
tion from academia to starting a venture [17] represents a
second path that drives translations: the movement of peo-
ple. People move across gaps and steps, such as students or
professors working in industry temporarily through sabbati-
cals, collaborative projects, or consulting, permanently after
graduating or after a career change. People carry knowledge
and skills with them. Most participants mentioned that in-
dustry researchers, for example, whether trained in applied
or basic research, can help translate the terminology of aca-
demic contributions (both in TBD and TAD). We interviewed
industry researchers with academic training, who shared
how they have used academic research to inform their work.
First, industry researchers said that, most commonly, their
knowledge of research methods is employed on a day to
day basis. Second, they use scientific findings to inform the
creation of study protocols and initial product design direc-
tions. In these two latter cases, industry researchers benefit
from their academic experience in reading and conducting
scientific studies to quickly evaluate and identify takeaways
in existing bodies of knowledge, contextualizing that knowl-
edge to the problems that their companies face for the design
of products or services (P12, P16, P17, P40, P42).
Connected to the points above, most participants called

out one particular form of people transfer  education  as
perhaps the most common path for HCI to influence design
practice. Academia usually contributes to society with re-
search findings, but HCI researchers in academia also partici-
pate in the training of practitioners. Multiple HCI professors
mentioned that teaching HCI theory in classes is challenging
and how to do so effectively is an open question. How do
we effectively train people to be sensitive and make them think
about these questions [referring to information privacy and
persuasive design] when they go into the workforce? (P1).

Formal and informal science communication. While papers
are a primary communication artifact among researchers,
time constraints hinder their use by industry researchers. To

bridge TAD and TBD gaps, generating curated resources is par-
ticularly important (P6, P12, P16, P20, P34 P42). I have time
to read the abstract basically. Id love to read more academic
papers, but everything is due yesterday in industry (P12). Par-
ticipants valued Nielsen reports (P12, P20, P34) and meetings
with scholars (P21, P40, P43) for helping them learn about
the latest relevant readings in a particular area.
Writing books, blog posts, presenting research in events,

talks, or informal conversations can also help bridge gaps.
Science communication can be done by writers, researchers
themselves, or collaboratively. Participants saw it as an im-
portant pathway to reach and influence scholars, practition-
ers, and public opinion (P1, P6, P7, P22, P23, P25), supporting
Smith et al. [65]. There is also a more informal approach to
science communication, where industry researchers use aca-
demic research opportunistically in discussions with their
product teams, or when academic researchers engage in
casual conversations with design practitioners about how
academic research can inform product development.
In translational science communication, a major barrier

is balancing scientific precision with writing content that
appeals to specific audiences. As in previous studies, HCI
practitioners reported difficulty reading research papers (P12,
P20, P21, P35, P37, P38). For the three science communicators
we interviewed (P22, P23, P25) the most significant issue in
working with scholars is their difficulty in explaining things
simply. P25 said that academics dislike having their work
translated because they want the original language in the
final piece. HCI scholars acknowledged this barrier and men-
tioned a struggle in balancing simple communication and
scientific precision. P1 has written blog posts and mentioned
that it is hard to break away from the academic writing style:
academics tend to be very fact-driven, and we have a certain
style of writing, and we get this feedback - you have to be
friendlier, you have to insert fun pieces, its just a different
style of writing to make it an engaging piece. So even if the
desire is there, the ability sometimes can be difficult. We are
more precise and nuanced in the way we describe things. P7
adds that she has hesitated to forego precision because study
results are not entirely generalizable to all populations.

5 DISCUSSION
By triangulating information from multiple stakeholders
involved in the TS process in HCI and models from other ap-
plied fields, we develop a model for TS in HCI that presents
a more nuanced view, with multiple gaps, barriers within
each, and corresponding translation efforts. While this model
of multiple gaps has similarities to models developed in
medicine, it also has attributes unique to HCI. For exam-
ple, the HCI model is not linear. This is likely because HCI-
proposed innovations typically do not face the regulatory

constraints of medical research. There is much more flexibil-
ity for research insights to directly influence design practice,
without rigorous testing and evaluation.

Below, we discuss the implications of using our proposed
model of TS in HCI. We then consider how to coordinate
translational efforts to move scientific HCI research into
the hands and minds of practitioners, and the importance
of engaging  and studying how to engage  with other
translators in Translational Science.

The Value of a Translational Science Model for HCI
The Translational Science process in HCI can be described
as a "continuum" since various resources and actions are
involved in a progression of knowledge, advancing discover-
ies towards design practice. There are gaps in this progres-
sion and using models can make translational research more
likely to succeed [68]. Woolf describes several benefits of
a TS model that distinguishes different steps, translations,
and disseminations [74]. These include repositioning transla-
tional barriers into a more specific arrangement, helping to
understand where translation occurs or has stalled. Second,
models of TS can support discussions about allocation of
resources that facilitate Translational Science.

First, our model can be used to reposition and study trans-
lational barriers more precisely. Previous work has generated
a translational barriers taxonomy [36], resulting from discus-
sions between HCI practitioners and researchers [11] that
have been framed by a view of a single gap between research
and practice. In our model, we specify nuanced barriers and
offer additional insights into how to address them. For exam-
ple, publishing academic papers to broadcast findings within
the scientific community is still important; it is not, however
 and should not be  a functional communication channel
between research and practice [27].
Also, HCI scholars doing research on Translational Sci-

ence may describe the aim of their research more clearly
with our terms, while helping to refine model constructs. For
example, the TS HCI model may be used to describe where
research has progressed or stalled (e.g., use of design appli-
cations found in HCI research is delayed in TAD). The model
highlights explicitly that applicability is the most significant
barrier for HCI research to influence practice in TAD, so, to
facilitate the translation of work stalled at this stage, the HCI
community might focus on translations that make it easier
for practitioners to apply theory-driven resources.

Second, our model can help understand areas where struc-
tural support is needed. Funding agencies and universities
are essential pieces of Translational Science in HCI [17, 38],
as they help drive and support research with broad social
and economic implications [21]. Our model can help organi-
zations more precisely target steps and barriers where vital
advances are stalled, and catalyze work that can facilitate

translation. For example, with a more specific TS model, the
health field devised initiatives such as dedicated budgets,
research centers, scientific journals, and conferences for dif-
ferent Ts [18, 24, 74]. While we do not argue that all of the
initiatives listed above are necessary for more robust TS in
HCI, they should at least be considered. Foremost, invest-
ment in the translation of basic and applied research for use
in design practice is vital for capitalizing on investments in
producing new insights. An excellent example is a specific
project that emerged in the health domain context: a plan to
reduce cancer mortality by 2025 consisting of concentrating
translational research in a few centers that can vet and test
scientific findings clusters with the most potential [16].

Multiple Translations and Translators
HCI is uniquely positioned and capable of addressing trans-
lational barriers, as it sits at the intersection between social
sciences, computer science, and technology [14]. Focusing
HCIs attention on each gap will help increase both the im-
pact of research and the pace of advancement in the field.
The constellation of parties involved in translating HCI

knowledge is broader than just the sub-communities of HCI
researchers and design practitioners. We found that these
parties already cooperate and transition across steps and
gaps. Based on our findings and results of previous SIGs [36],
rather than creating a new profession [50], we believe there is
a need to leverage and coordinate the incredibly diverse and
capable parties already somehow involved in Translational
Science efforts, especially those who can  and want to 
do more translational work (while explaining the value of
doing so to others who could become translators). Below,
we address efforts that, in addition to the findings that we
presented, hold promise as effective channels to strengthen
TS in HCI and should be developed or further studied.

The scientific publication cycle helps bridge TBA. While
this gap suffers less with understanding barriers, major ad-
vances could be clustered and communicated to ensure that
knowledge is progressing throughout the TS model. To ac-
complish this, existing infrastructure can be leveraged and
expanded upon, such as crowdsourced sites to summarize
published research [3], and perhaps new ways to aggregate
and discover knowledge clusters on Google Scholar and other
academic work search-engines [35].
Our model also highlights an intra-community gap that

needs to be considered. TAA gap raises concerns about frag-
mentation within the HCI community. As the HCI commu-
nity grows, it is essential to encourage learning about, en-
gaging with, and citing research across application areas and
ways of knowing.

In TBD and TAD, translators such as science communica-
tors and industry researchers help share curated academic
knowledge with design practitioners (similar to what Everett

Rogers described as change agents [57].) HCI practitioners
already use social media sites such as Reddit and Medium
to publish and discuss prominent issues. For example, the
/r/userexperience reddit community [2] provides a venue
for more than 32,000 UX amateurs and professionals to com-
municate [40], and 211,000 users follow the UX Collective
Medium publication [4]. How can we better leverage these
platforms for sharing HCI knowledge?

One other dissemination pathway is the education of stu-
dents and researchers on the complexities of translating sci-
entific findings. A key question for education is whether
current HCI education is sufficient, or if the community
should train new kinds of translators or develop translation
resources for existing translators in other fields. While Nor-
man proposed the training of translational developers [50],
our model suggests that different skills and training may be
needed to prepare people who will help bridge each distinct
gap. We could potentially train many translators and must
consider this diversity of skills and roles in training for TS.
In TAD specifically, HCI has the opportunity to translate

research results into resources that practitioners can use. HCI
scientific findings are usually shared through papers which
introduce and enforce the applicability barrier, as products
of the research process are often not ready for immediate use
by practitioners [8, 71] and rarely consider the practicalities
of everyday design practice [32]. The literature describes
many different tools that can help communicate research
findings, such as training modules, workshops, technical
support, and guides [30, 68]. In HCI specifically, many ve-
hicles for HCI knowledge have been proposed but should
be more systematically evaluated [7], such as strong con-
cepts [33], different instantiations of design patterns [5],
scenarios [13], personas [20], conceptual models [49], design
concepts [62], design heuristics [26], research objects [51], de-
sign fiction [73], tutorials [25], methods [32], and assets [19].

Must we measure knowledge adoption? Describing the pro-
cess of adopting and adapting HCI research to practice, Chi-
lana et al. [17] ask whether studying knowledge adoption is
beyond the scope of HCI. We believe that there is a need to
explore what it means for an HCI contribution to be adopted
beyond prototypes [31], mining research insights, and trans-
lating them to how designers want to be supported, into
practical, evidence-based resources [50, 58]. Designing eval-
uations of knowledge adoption could bring empirical value
to the design field. Our findings support this approach by
suggesting tackling the applicability barrier in TAD to facili-
tate the adoption and application of knowledge is necessary.
Here, there are many obvious strands of work in the in-
tersection of TAD with diffusion of innovation studies and
knowledge adoption at individual and organizational lev-
els [57], as well as many relatable user-centered methods to

Table 3: Additional Translators that can facilitate Translational Science in HCI and should be further investigated.

Translators Evidence
Policymakers Mentioned by participants as a growing and effective role for regulating practice (P1, P3, P7, P26). Policymakers have a need for facts

based on the best knowledge currently available [72]. Lazar [43] even affirms that, for example, for accessibility researchers to have any
real impact outside of the research community, they need to understand law and work with policymakers.

Professional asso-
ciations

UXPA or IxDA for example are organizations that frequently set up local events for the HCI community. Our participants believe that a
stronger link with these associations can help establish interfaces between researchers and practitioners. Researchers have partnered with
meetup groups and professional organizations to organize events combining academic and industry talks [19], but practitioners rarely meet
with researchers at these events [50, 66] and it is unclear how effective they are at supporting adoption of HCI knowledge.

Business stake-
holders

Business-related stakeholders, such as marketing, financing, and venture capital. There is an understudied pathway in turning academic
research into commercial products and services, a path documented in [17] and mentioned by a few participants in our study (P1, P3, P7,
P8, P13, P15, P17).

Society, end-users Some HCI researchers said that they are not interested in influencing design practice, but in working directly with the populations that can
benefit from their work (P5, P8). Ladner points to working with end-users to tackle their problems through an open science approach as
an alternative [41]. Some participants also mentioned working with the media to influence public opinion. This way, users would demand
change from companies. (P1, P7, P43).

Funding agencies as described in the discussion session, top-down stimuli can promote structural change and reorganize infrastructures to facilitate Transla-
tional Science. More work about  and with  decision-makers of funding agencies is necessary.

uncover stakeholder needs that help align user needs with
business needs [17]. There is currently little incentive for
HCI scholars to invest more time and resources in under-
standing adoption [17]. If a researcher aims at influencing
design practice  to bridge from TBD or TAD  then evalu-
ating knowledge adoption [45] may be necessary to know
whether one has succeeded.

Engaging  and studying engagement  with translators. HCI
must continue to engage with everyday successes and prob-
lems practitioners face in their work. An effective feedback
loop in Translational Science helps keep applied fields grounded
in and relevant for practice. For example, asking questions
such as "Is this privacy recommendation found in a CHI pa-
per effective, or used/adapted in different ways in practice?"
Research with a focus on professional design practices allows
insight into how practitioners refine and concretize abstract
knowledge [32, 42]. Previous work provides guidance for the
in-situ study of professional design practice [31] or using
social media traces to learn about design practice in [39].
While the abovementioned examples focus on sharing

knowledge with design practitioners, they are only one role
in TS in HCI. Schneiderman advocates for building the ca-
pacity to collaborate and coordinate with many stakehold-
ers, blending scientists, engineers, designers, and end-users
to produce "higher-impact research converging into a so-
lution" [64]. We were impressed by the many original and
creative translations that the HCI community, represented
through our 43 participants and referenced authors, has
found to bridge and study research and practice in HCI. Fu-
ture work should strive to understand the barriers to and
effective strategies for engaging the range of stakeholders in
TS for HCI (See Table 3).

6 CONCLUSION
The presence of barriers that hamper the progression of
knowledge into design practice is a significant issue within

HCI. Therefore, it is necessary to understand how knowledge
progresses, or fails to progress, from research to practice.
To design the model for Translational Science in HCI, we
drew on past work and interview data with researchers,
practitioners, andmultiple parties who are engaged  or not
in translating HCI knowledge. In our continuum, we describe
multiple steps and gaps between basic and applied research,
and design practice. We also identify multiple translators and
the translational work they do. This model offers insights on
how to bridge translational gaps and how to work with and
train translators effectively. It also acts as a foundation for
future research on Translational Science in HCI.
