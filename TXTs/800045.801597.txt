bABSTRACTnnc3 environments have increasingly incorporated computer controlled maps as decision aids The design of map displays in space oriented c3 systems has taken on greater importance due to the complex spatial relationships among orbiting objects The large number of objects orbiting the globe and their great speeds further complicates efforts to quickly and accurately portray their positions graphicallynThis paper describes an experimental plan aimed at evaluating a new 2D3D hybrid space situation map display The Hybrid display is created by opening a globe at the south pole and flattening it into a platter A third dimension is obtained by tilting the platter It was hypothesized that the Hybrid display would offer an advantage to c3 system operators and analysts dealing with three dimensional rrhlems The test plan focuses on perceptual pararueters and user preference issues concernin conventional and Hybrid display techniques lhe results of this study will be examined to direct future work on dynamic displays and the impact of display design approach on cognitive performancenBackgroundnA map display can be thought of as a special case or subset in the general domain of graphic information displays Maps are essentially abstract representations of selected geographic data and spatial relationships Thus maps especially tactical or situation maps rely heavily on the use of the followingn0 abstract symbology 0 visually coded data groupingnnSnno scaling factors o varying degrees of graphic and alphanumeric content to represent an area or a situation in an areannThe area or situation being represented by a map can be visually presented using different combinations applications and emphasis of the above features The specific combination and content chosen defines the maps design approachnnIntuitively one would expect different map design approaches to be more or less appropriate for the performance of certain tasks Some empirical verification of this notion has in fact emerged in several recent investigations Rogers 1980 found tht terrain relief maps used to plan mapoftheearth flight need to be augmented with more information than terrain relief alone to be useful to aviators In another studynnWeltman 1979 found that the use of a full range of scaling factors and dynamic realism facilitated significantly better orientation and knowledge of an area than did traditional paper maps Noyes 1980 conducted a study of visual search in map displays which showed that certain material close to words on a display has a proximity effect which prolongs word recognition timennThese and other investigations e
