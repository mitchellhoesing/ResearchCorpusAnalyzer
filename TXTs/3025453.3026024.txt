bABSTRACTn We explore the relative merits of matrix nodelink and combined sidebyside views for the visualisation of weighted networks with three controlled studies 1 finding the most effective visual encoding for weighted edges in matrix representations 2 comparing matrix nodelink and combined views for static weighted networks and 3 comparing MatrixWave Sankey and combined views of both for eventsequence data
